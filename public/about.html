<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Born and raised in Houston, Texas, I have always had a passion for art, design, and working with my hands. As a child, I started out in photography and hand drawing things with pencil and paper. As time went on, I realized that the digital world was the future, and I wanted to be a part of it. I started out using Paint and eventually made the transition to using Photoshop, Illustrator, and other programs. My passion for art and design helps me to develop my ever growing skills, as well as come up with new and innovative ideas, I can share with the world.</p>

<p>I am not just a designer, I also specialize in illustration, photography, print, web development, ui/ux design, and branding. I know that’s a lot to specialize in, but I am the kind of person who likes to have a lot of skills. I guess I would consider myself as a sort of swiss army knife in the design and development community, so I can meet whatever needs you have.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, you can find me working on my digital art, trying new things with code or playing video games. I also like to spend time working with my hands/getting my hands dirty, usually on a car. I consider myself as a gamer, a geek, and a gear head. I can also be found learning something new (right now it’s React and Python). I do also like staying fit, usually by hitting the gym and playing tennis.</p>
